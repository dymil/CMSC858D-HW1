# OCaml Wavelet Trees
OCaml implementations of succinct bitvector rank/select – in constant and logarithmic (via binary search) time, respectively – and wavelet trees, wrapping the [Bitv](https://github.com/backtracking/bitv) library.

## Installation
I suggest using [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to install OCaml, OCamlfind, and Bitv.
